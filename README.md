# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 I tried to do class by class but because of the nature of coding there was a lot of interrealtions so I pivoted to creating 
 what worked about better, not working on only one class at a time but switching between them, adding and deleting code that worked and didn't work.
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

 This may have been something we learnt in class that I completley missed but realising that I could nest methods outside of main(String [] args) (I intially thought that methods could only be nested withing that only since I started coding in java). dicovering that was really helpful with my code.

 I had to figure out how to make my random not random so that questions wouldn't be repeated.

 I had to also figure out how to convert things from one class type to another.
 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 I wish I had figured out a proper way to have the character move about the school. I would have liked them to move about using coordinates.
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 I would have implemented the time feature. I would have also liked to have had the song that was chosen playing.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

 The most helpful feedback I recieved was not directly related to the interworkings of my code but was provided by Razieh when I went to office hours. In essense I was told to calm down and that something I had shown her was correct. I think while coding I get really bogged down and doubt my ablities but hearing that just gave me the confidence to proceed.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

 Start earlier. 
 Do the Javadoc throughout the creation of the code as doing it all at once can be overwhelming.
 Creating a randomizer class instead of creating of a random method in another class makes randomization way easier.
 Focus on what you do know and don't over complicate.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
